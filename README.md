# lunar-mail
ðŸŒ™ A basic, configurable mailing endpoint.

## What's lunar-mail?

After spending hours and hours frustrated with dealing with a client that wanted constant email edits, I thought that there had to be a better way to handle emails. lunar-mail aims to partially solve this issue. lunar-mail is an endpoint that you post with basic merge fields for an email, and it handles the rest.

lunar-mail tries to solve the issue with mailing config and ensuring that required merge fields are filled.
